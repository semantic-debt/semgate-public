    """Host-neutral decision pipeline shared by every hook adapter.

    The host adapter supplies how to build the envelope from the operator's
    grant, the session id, the host's step id (for outcome recording) and a
    function returning the user's own messages this session. `record_step`
    is the per-call id the host's post-tool event will carry (default: the
    same as step_idx; None when the host has no per-call id, which turns off
    the F4/F6 pre-records for that host). `session_started_at` returns the
    host transcript's first timestamp (ISO string or epoch; "" when unknown);
    with the G2 switch on (policy router.code_signals) the session start for
    signal S1 is the earliest of it and the first ledger entry for this
    session. `store_problems`: stores the adapter could not read before the
    decision (e.g. the tool output store, semgate.tooloutputs); each one
    fails closed like a lock timeout (an allow becomes force_ask).
    `extra_evidence`: {key: dict} added to the judgment's evidence when the
    dict is non-empty at judge time (it may be filled by build_envelope).
    `chat` (chatapproval.HostChat): the host's conversation reader for
    approval by chat reply (policy router.chat_approval, off by default;
    see chatapproval.py). None: never used.
    `_after_pin` (internal): this call is the second judgment of the same
    action, after pingate.maybe_pin pinned the instruction-file lines the
    user trusted in chat; no second pin is tried.
    Returns the
    native Antigravity vocabulary (allow / ask / force_ask / deny /
