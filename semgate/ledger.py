"""Append-only JSONL ledger: judgments, reviewer overrides, outcomes.

Record types share one file, distinguished by `record_type`:
  - judgment: the decision semgate produced, with policy version and votes.
              `judgment_id` is the envelope content digest, not an event id.
  - host_response: the exact object a harness hook returned to its host,
              keyed by (conversation_id, step_idx)
  - override: a reviewer disagreeing with a judgment
  - outcome:  what eventually happened (human approved/denied, action reverted)
  - incident: something seen after a decision that it did not see (F4:
              a script changed between the decision and the run)
  - chat_approval: a step of approval by chat reply (chatapproval.py)
  - trust_request: the agent ran `semgate trust add` (trustgate.py)
  - pin_request: semgate asked about instruction-file lines (pingate.py)
  - serve_event: `semgate serve --stdio` saw a plugin stamp, or its code
              changed on disk (hot reload; serve.py)

The ledger is the only thing the judge writes. It is the evidence trail that
later calibration and (much later) any non-shadow behavior must be built on.
