"""The gate for `semgate trust add` when the AGENT runs it through a host tool.

`semgate trust add "<cmd>"` makes semgate allow <cmd> without asking (trust.py).
rules.py makes every command that may run it a human gate (`trust_request`)
and hard-denies it when <cmd> is a hard-rule command. `semgate feedback allow`
stays a hard deny for the agent (rules.HARD_DENY_PATTERNS); a trust add is not,
because the user may ask the agent to add one ("always allow npm run e2e").

run_core calls apply() for a decision with the trust_request gate. It allows
the call only when ALL hold (policy switch `router.trust_requests: true`, off
by default; question `router.trust_questions.user_requested_trust`; threshold
max(MIN_P, `trust_request_min`)):

a. code, the conversation (the host adapter's user turns, the same reader as
   chat approval: Claude Code transcript, agy transcript, OpenCode V1/V2
   session messages, Codex rollout, Pi session branch): the latest user turn
   is real user input (tool outputs, agent text and harness text are never
   user turns) and the agent made no other tool call after it; and semgate's
   own ledger: the previous judged tool call of this session is older than
   that user turn (when the host stamps turns; a turn without a time fails);
b. the judge: P(user_requested_trust) >= the threshold, from a state with
   the command to trust, its scope (project, days), ONLY the user turns since
   the agent's previous tool call and, labeled as the agent's, the agent's
   last message before the user's latest turn. No answer, a timeout or a
   provider error: not allowed;
c. code: the command can be trusted at all (trust.refuse_reason: not a
   hard-rule command, ...); this call carries no untrusted_instruction gate;
   no judgment of this session flagged the command (or a trust add of it) as
   following untrusted content (untrusted_instruction, injection_deny, an
   instructed_by_context vote "injected"). A file named it: the user must
   run `semgate trust add` in their own terminal;
d. code: one simple command `semgate trust add "<cmd>" [--days N]` whose
   quoting bash and PowerShell read the same way (trust.parse_add), and
   1 <= N <= 30; the folder it runs in belongs to the session's project
   (the trust is stored for the folder it runs in).

When all hold, the hook writes a one-time approval ticket for exactly this
request (trustauth.issue_ticket: kind, command or file lines, days,
project, session, agent host process, 120 s) and allows the call. The CLI
writes the trust only with that ticket or in the user's own terminal
(trustauth.py), so `$S trust add`, an alias or a wrapper script that the
text rules miss gets no trust. A ticket that cannot be written: not allowed.

Otherwise (enforcing) the decision is a deny, also on a host that shows
asks: approving a host prompt cannot add the trust (no ticket), so the
reason starts with a note for the agent: ask the user (NOTE), or, for (c)
untrusted content, do not ask, tell the user which file asked for it
(UNTRUSTED_NOTE). A trust request is never approved by a chat reply
(chatapproval).

Every call is a `trust_request` record in the ledger: allowed / not_allowed
(the judge said no or gave no answer) / code_rejected, with p, why, and a
hash of the user turns (never their text).
