"""Router policy: one provider call with typed questions, decision table in code.

This is an alternative semantic stage, selected with `"kind": "router"` in the
policy file. Hard rules and human gates still run first and are untouched.

The provider answers three independent questions about a small state
(`command`, `operator_purpose`, `user_message`) in a single call:
  - route      (choice): run | review | block
  - effect     (score) : what the action does to the machine, ordered levels
  - user_asked (noul)  : does the user's latest message ask for this action?

The model never decides. This module combines the answers with thresholds that
live in the policy file, so every threshold is versioned with the policy hash.
`user_asked` can stop a deny and explain an ask. It can never produce an allow
unless the operator sets `user_asked_allow_effect_max` explicitly.
